Code with GitHub Copilot
GitHub Copilot can help you code by offering autocomplete-style suggestions right in VS Code and Codespaces.

Step 1: Leverage Codespaces with VS Code for Copilot
Welcome to "Develop With AI Powered Code Suggestions Using GitHub Copilot and VS Code"! üëã

GitHub Copilot is an AI pair programmer that helps you write code faster and with less work. It draws context from comments and code to suggest individual lines and whole functions instantly. GitHub Copilot is powered by OpenAI Codex, a generative pretrained language model created by OpenAI.

Copilot works with many code editors including VS Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDE, and Neovim.

Additionally, GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language.

Using Copilot inside a Codespace shows just how easy it is to get up and running with GitHub's suite of Collaborative Coding tools.

Note This skills exercise will focus on leveraging GitHub Codespace. It is recommended that you complete the GitHub skill, Codespaces, before moving forward with this exercise.

‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Enable Copilot inside a Codespace
We recommend opening another browser tab to work through the following activities so you can keep these instructions open for reference.

Before you open up a codespace on a repository, you can create a development container and define specific extensions or configurations that will be used or installed in your codespace. Let's create this development container and add copilot to the list of extensions.

Navigating back to your Code tab of your repository, click the Add file drop-down button, and then click Create new file.

Type or paste the following in the empty text field prompt to name your file.

.devcontainer/devcontainer.json
In the body of the new .devcontainer/devcontainer.json file, add the following content:

{
    // Name this configuration
    "name": "Codespace for Skills!",
    "customizations": {
        "vscode": {
            "extensions": [
                "GitHub.copilot"
            ]
        }
    }
}
